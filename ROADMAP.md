# ROADMAP — SDR Oxide, the SWL edition

What this fork is for: turning sdroxide's receiver into the best **shortwave
listening** program it can be — no licence, no callsign, no transmitting unless
asked for. This file is the plan; it changes as the fork teaches us what
matters.

Ordered by value to a listener, not by effort. Each phase is meant to stand on
its own.

## Phase 1 — the listener's identity

**Done.** **SWL mode** now hides the transmit controls *and* swaps the
DX-cluster/POTA/SOTA spots and the awards for the listener's windows, a
**LISTEN window** with the
SWL reception log — station, frequency, UTC, mode, language, **SINPO or SIO**,
S-meter, notes — and a **REPORT** button that writes the entry as a reception
report to send to the broadcaster. The log lives in `swl_log.json`, its own
file, and records what was *heard* rather than worked.

The goal it was built for: opening the program should feel like a listener's
radio, not a transceiver with the transmit parts hidden.

- **Listener profile.** One setting that sets SWL mode and Simple UI, and hides
  the ham *receive* chrome that means nothing to a listener — awards
  (DXCC/WAS/WAZ), the DX-cluster/POTA/SOTA spots, QSL uploads — replacing them
  with station, schedule and propagation.
- **SWL listening log.** A log that records what was *heard*, not what was
  worked: station (from the schedule where known), frequency, UTC, mode,
  **SINPO/SIO**, language, programme notes, and an S-meter reading.
- **Reception report.** Generate a ready-to-send report for a station
  (station, date/time UTC, frequency, SINPO, receiver/antenna), the way SWLs
  report to broadcasters.

## Phase 2 — the broadcast schedule (the centrepiece)

**Almost done.** The **SCHEDULE window** browses the EiBi table: filter by a
chosen UTC time (or now), by metre band, language and target, and by free text
over name/site/country/language/target. A row can be **TUNE**d, or **LOG**ged
straight into the reception log with the station, language and site filled in.

**Complete.** Favourites are in: a row carries a star, starred stations are kept
by name in `broadcast_favourites.json`, and a **★ FAVS** filter shows only them
— tied to the station rather than to a bare frequency.

## Phase 3 — listening tools

- **Time-shift buffer / instant replay.** **Done** — a rolling two-minute window
  (mono, ~23 MB per receiver) and a **REPLAY** control in the LISTEN window: a
  DVR two minutes behind live. The CAT-audio path is not covered yet.
- **Scheduled recordings.** **Done** — a job is a start time, a frequency, a
  mode, a duration and what to capture (audio / I/Q / both); the RECORDINGS
  window lists and edits them, and a scheduler runs the engine's recorder. The
  filename is the engine's own for now; naming it after the station is a
  follow-up.
- **ECSS.** **Done** — two one-sided SAM presets, ECSS-U and ECSS-L, that keep
  one sideband and reject the other: the medium-wave DX trick for ducking an
  adjacent channel. Deliberately on SAM alone; AM and C-QUAM would not honour
  it.
- **Listener audio chain.** **Tone done** — a low-shelf / peak / high-shelf on
  the demodulated audio, in front of the speakers, edited in the LISTEN window.
  Noise reduction aimed at broadcast rather than speech is still open; the
  bandwidth side is the existing filter.

## Phase 4 — polish

- **UTC first**: **UTC clock done** in the SCHEDULE and LISTEN windows, where a
  listener works. A general "UTC everywhere" pass is still open.
- **Utility labels**: VOLMET, time signals, numbers stations — the same idea as
  the broadcast labels. Needs a small built-in utility table; not started.
- **DRM for the listener**: show the programme text and MOT slideshow, not just
  the audio. **Blocked**: the DRM decoder is vendored (Dream) and does not hand
  its MOT/journaline stream out, so this needs work in `sdroxide-drm` first.
- **Band scanning for listeners**: walk 49 m and stop on carriers, with the
  station name. The scanner exists; not started.

## Not goals

- **Transmitting.** SWL mode is the default; there is no push to make transmit
  first-class here. It stays available for anyone who wants it, behind the
  upstream lockouts.
- **Ham operating aids.** Awards, contesting and QSL chasing are upstream's and
  stay read-only-or-hidden.
- **The CB band.** This fork grew out of the CB/SWL fork and still carries its
  11 m work; it is not the focus here and may be retired or hidden as the
  listener features take over.

## Relationship to upstream

Seeded from the CB/SWL fork (`madmedicnl/sdroxide`), which is a fork of
`dividebysandwich/sdroxide`. Upstream changes are merged in periodically; a
feature that is useful to *anyone* (not just listeners) is a candidate to offer
upstream as a pull request rather than keep here.
